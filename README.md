# COVID-19
Download, convert and load COVID-19 information into influxdb.
This "app" will load the CSV of Covid-19 and convert them for loading into an influxDB.
As the source is being updated once a day, you should run this app three times a day.
In addition, I would recommend using appNew.js. The reason for that is the issue with the recovered figures from JSU.
